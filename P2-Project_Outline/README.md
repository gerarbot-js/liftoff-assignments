## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Borne from two separate ideas about making mental healthcare easier to find for individuals, the Mental Healthcare Access App allows English and Spanish speaking users the ability to find appropriate, qualified, and available therapists in their area. The app uses a search feature for area therapists that filters results by therapist specialty, proximity, availability, price, and rating. Returned results will include the therapist's contact info that users can flag for future reference. The user can view a list of all the therapists that they've flagged so they can follow up and make an appointment if they so desire and therapists can be added and removed from this list at any point. All features of the site will be available in both English and Spanish.

### Features
